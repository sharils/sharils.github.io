# Notes for [A Career Cold Start Algorithm][1]

1. For the first 25 minutes: ask them to tell you everything they think you
   should know. Take copious notes. Only stop them to ask about things you
   don’t understand. Always stop them to ask about things you don’t understand.
2. For the next 3 minutes: ask about the biggest challenges the team has right
   now.
3. In the final 2 minutes: ask who else you should talk to. Write down every
   name they give you.
