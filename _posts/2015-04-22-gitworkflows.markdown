[The gitworkflows(7)
illustrated](http://www.slideshare.net/ktateish/the-gitworkflows7-illustrated) is a
slide explaining every detail.

[Git - gitworkflows Documentation](http://git-scm.com/docs/gitworkflows) is the
man page. You can also type man gitworkflows in the command line.

I have only one extra step that is to rebase before each merge. This makes the
history clean.
