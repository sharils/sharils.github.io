# Notes for [Productivity - Sam Altman][1]

## WHAT YOU WORK ON

- It doesn’t matter how fast you move if it’s in a worthless direction
- Develop the confidence to stick with your convictions
- Leave enough time to think about what to work on
- One can’t be very productive working on things one don’t care about or don’t like
- Not liking what you’re doing for a long period of time, seriously consider a major job change
- You can learn anything you want
- Try to be around smart, productive, happy, and positive people

## PRIORITIZATION

- Make sure to get the important shit done
- Don’t waste time on stupid shit
- make a lot of lists
- prioritize in a way that generates momentum
- generally try to avoid meetings and conferences
- enough space in your schedule to allow for chance encounters and exposure to new people and ideas
- Having an open network is valuable
- most meetings are best scheduled for 15-20 minutes, or 2 hours
- my most productive time of the day, so I don’t let anyone schedule anything then
- switch tasks, whenever I feel my attention starting to fade
- It doesn’t matter what system you use or if you squeeze out every second if you’re working on the wrong thing.

## PHYSICAL FACTORS

- Sleep tracker e.g. [Emfit QS+Active][2]
- Sleep, cold, dark, quiet room, and a great mattress e.g. [TEMPUR-Contour™ Elite][3]
- Not eating a lot in the few hours before sleep helps
- [Chili Pad][4]
- [Eye mask][5] and [ear plugs][6]
- [Full spectrum LED light][7] most mornings for about 10-15 minutes
- Exercise
- Nutrition, avoid sugar, avoid foods that aggravate my digestion or spike up inflammation
- methyl B-12, Omega-3, Iron, and Vitamin D-3 with a year or so of quarterly [blood tests][8]

## OTHER STUFF

- Natural light
- Quiet
- Knowing that I won’t be interrupted if I don’t want to be
- Long blocks of time
- Being comfortable and relaxed
- Wrote custom software for the annoying things I have to do frequently
- Keyboard shortcuts that help with my workflow
- Like most people, I sometimes go through periods of a week or two where I just have no motivation to do anything
- Oid people and situations that put me in bad moods
- In general, I think it’s good to overcommit a little bit
- Train to avoid distractions
- Don’t neglect your family and friends for the sake of productivity
- Don’t neglect doing things you love or that clear your head either
- Productivity in the wrong direction isn’t worth anything at all. Think more about what to work on
