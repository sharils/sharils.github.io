- [CSS Selectors Cheat Sheet](https://web.archive.org/web/20170902040437/http://css4-selectors.com:80/selectors/)
- `:link`, `:visited`, `:focus`, `:hover`, `:active`
- `:visited` has [styling restrictions](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/:visited#Styling_restrictions).
- `:lang` is more robust than `[lang]`
- `:indeterminate` can only be set through the DOM API at the writing of the book.
