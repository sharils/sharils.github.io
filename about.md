Hi, my name is Folio Lin. Folio means leaf in Esperanto. Because I like leaf green thus the name. I'm passionate about learning languages. And Esperanto is just the beginning.

The reason I became an engineer is that I believe it's 2018, most of the problem should have already been solved. But people are still complaining that software is difficult to use. Why? My answer to that question is UX. So I decided that I want to become an engineer who builds great UX when I was a college kid.

However, after a couple years of working experience, I found that great UX doesn't come from a single person. It comes from a whole team of people. So I became an engineer who cares about the team.

What I've discovered since I'd started working is that I love sharing, I love sharing what I've learned from day to day to my colleagues, local meetups, even in the largest annual JavaScript developer conference in Taiwan! I just love sharing knowledge so much.
